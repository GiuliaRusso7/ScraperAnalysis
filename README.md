# ScraperAnalysis

## 4D Transfer Matrix Linear Care no Coupling
In this code the beam is generated at the beginning of the AD ring and transfported by means of the 4D transfer matrix at the scraper location.
Here a n-turn maps is implemented to simulate the scraper measurements. Losses are recored as they would occur in the real case and the emittance is reconstructed by means of the Abel Transform as well as by fitting the losses. Comparison between the 2 appraoches provides information on how good the process is/
